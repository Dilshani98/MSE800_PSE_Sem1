#Scenario


--- YooBee College wants to develop a database system to manage their academic & administrative tasks. 
College offers several course modules for large number of students who are following Master of Software Engineering program. 
These students can entroll into more than one course module. Each course module can have more than one student. There are many teachers, each of them 
assigned to more than one course module to deliver the lectures.

The attached ER diagram will explain more details about the specifications of each table. In this project we use python with sqlite3 to connect
with the database & insert 3 sample data into each table. Project includes the relevant functions to execute the queries to retrieve 
the number of students for MSE800 course and list all teachers name who are teaching MSE801.

There are inline comments in the code itself for the understanding of the concepts.----
